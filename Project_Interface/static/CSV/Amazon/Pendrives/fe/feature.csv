first time using sandisk drive quality cheap size smaller bigger thumb capacity storage 57gb mention 64gb around 78gb difference convert money around 200 rupees cheating cant tell truth least highly define techno age cant figure much small pendrive capacity ridiculous
usb drive gives less performance previous model usb drives drive gives maximum read speed 4550mbs write speed 810mbs 7 model sandisk cz48 usb drives gives maximum read speed 110113mbs write speed 2025 mbs specific pen drive giving poor performance maybe thats seller selling cheap price 329rs lightning deal
confident chose sandisk selected one best brand pen drive fine quality appears good use fell floor height 2 feet closed surprise would open noticed portion comes got displaced bit inside great deal effort could bring since left reflects mediocre quality similar pen drives years faced problem despite fallen several occasions otherwise ok
pen drive got write protected tried copy 16gb file onto drive drive stuck readonly state made numerous attempts fix drive luck contacted sandisk global customer care advised return drive issue might spread multiple sandisk drives check problems specific model listed making purchase

generally good usb pendrive loyal sandisk customer pendrives micro sd sdhc many years last two sandisk ultra pendrives purchased giving problems intermittent connections sudden messages saying need format drive use even though data use weeks lost data twice problem clearly isolated problem pendrives laptop usb port readwrite speeds acceptable gotten point cant trust pendrives need carry additional backup data well
dont like design partits mouth occupies much space inside usb port thatit make devices harder insert usb port thatit good buy
pros 1 material quality good metal usb body made plastic 2 product also durable also using 16gb variant 3 gently swipe front get plugged usb port 30 20 cons 1 100mbps speed reading speed writing speed 2 10x writing speed paper actual speed 15times normal pendrive

comparing many pendrive really loved design quality yeah expectation always considered heats minimum usage compared kingston pendrive heats lot better buy fyi also bought currently using
good quality great performance u take usb inside using chance breaking accident
pen drive genuine getting warm connected usb 20 usb 30 stand mode transferred file pendrive getting hot average read write speed 35mbs 25mbps respectively usb 20 port usb 30 port read write speed 110mbps 90mbps respectively
nice value money drive pros 4k read speeds approx 15mbps makes better boot drive os strontium one drive usage led glows pale blue colour drive used well built usb connector retractable memory management quick even drive near full buffer cleared pretty quickly cons buffer size 1gb copying files 1 gb writing speed reduces 30mbps to10mbps actual volume 286gb seen 32gb thumb drives 30 gb storage bit less
pendrive good one main disadvantage sliding option open pendrive break easily overall built quality good slide usb hub require force satisfied mechanism opening pendrive
one past second one works fine good thermal stability long hours pc plugging usb connector ejection housing much nicer positional latch feeling tine unlike last one bit jerky think sandisk improved mechanical slide first one bought 6 months ago
never used usb 30 thought great deal high storage well first even come closer transfer speed mentioned example never got 15mpbs write speed first 2 minutes post drops 10mpbs several times even went 34mpbs 56 20 pen drives always gave consistent write speeds 6mpbs even bizarre part 20 drives gave read speed 2530mpbs always consistent btw might used 20 pen drives 1000 times past several years whereas product read speed also less 5mbps 2530mpbs first 2 minutes drops less 5mpbs experience heating issues far please avoid product amazon delivery outstanding usual
truly value money product never seen excellent pendrive affordable price mention device doesnt give speed check usb ports usb port also usb 30 compatible give insane speeds written officially sandisk give upto 100mbs read speeds upto 50mbs write speeds true checked speedout software got constant 95mbs write 48mbs read speeds also movie file 28gb transferred pendrive 1 minute storage available use 286gb build quality also great also get free rescuepro deluxe licence key 1year subscription really worth every penny
great product price range usb 30 supports greater data transfer speed drive comes built security tool protect data case drive loss theft additional benefit sandisk drive compared vendors extra cost end user go product
pendrive comes second number best pendrives listed rather 32 gb say 16gb pendrive better deal speed transferring secure vault inside also good stylish also matters know build quality also good using daily go without doubt
device good great build quality decent light weight product however speed data transfer device per usb 30 actual transfer speed ranges 20 30 mbps data transfers speed stable keeps fluctuating another draw back product size takes much space attaching device beside possible unless computer systems good enough space usb ports overall ok product recommended buy price value drops inr 250 300
second purchase flash drive data transfer speeds fast even usb 20 pros 1 compact size 2 fast data transfer 3 heating problems really go even 64 gb capacity
received faulty itemstopped working first use got replacement device stop working first use disappointed initiated return refund process order different model product different seller
got 300 overall product good really liked read speed get around 114mbs way wd external hard drivein get around 95 mbs write speed poor get around 10mbs hard disk get around 80mbs way better gets heated quickly bearable
service provided amazon amazingbut quality sandisk badthough usb 30 pendrive providing enough speedwhile transferring data using 30 port computer giving 15mbsec writing max 20mbsec readingnot satisfied someone advised replace product dont think helpfulif got type productand even replacement process take long time advice think twice purchasing product might get speed transferring desire
pendrive good transferring speed files also perfect youre comparing pendrives gave four stars design laptops two ports side side plug pendrive one port width tad big cant plug devices second port
opened pendrive received seems like someone returned use want higher write speed memory stick booting purpose gives 1011 mbps write speed acceptable usb 30
earlier using cheap quality card reader due reasion memory card became corrupt using ball card reader simply superb cost maybe protect costly memory card becoming corrupt simply close eyes buy branded card reader ball
read write pendrive 100mb slow taken low prize using one time use software backup pc wont recommend
pc lappy 30 port go itits speed faster 20 pendrive build quality goodno heating problemsvery light weight corbon fiber body plus get sandisk secure folder inside pendrive okay file encryption get product key1 yearinside package software called rescuepro deluxe recovery software everything
working pc working music home theatre lg tv say problem usb check usb dvr cpplus dvr connected second time connected dvr say device detected storage show device abnormal

read buying worst pendrive ever purchased 1 heats like toaster within minute connect computer 2 according sandisk stupid write protect system drives locks drive randomly cannot write anything matter happens pendrive usless way get replacement un india cannot ask replacement website short lost 1k non sense protection system info found sandisk website
dont buy pen drive read write speeds become slow period time speed like 300kbpsslower 20 pendrive bought pendrive seeing lot reviews didnt work
good product sandisk read write speeds also good first started using pendrive tensed 1014 seconds transfer speed gradually went formatted used speed phenomenal providing screenshot proof
bought sandisk pendrives realized transfer speeds really really low even even usb 30 dont buy expecting 30 speed barely get transfer speed 15mbs small file sizes larger file sizes 11 mbps
little confussion peoples getting 10mbps speed first thing usb 30 supports newer harddrive ssd harddisk literally supported 30 thats getting 10mbps write speed try mobile give 100mbps guys dont get confuse things first clearly take information
use mac os installer quite fast compared usb 20 devices extra ordinarily fast price usb 20 could ask concern heats quickly plastic remains cool connected part heats lot

hello guys reviewing unit help guysthis pendrive looks stunning box pretty light made hard plastic grip good iti got pendrive 449 delivery chargesafter getting connected laptop see much speed im getting noticed copied computer pendrive getting speed 9 10mb per second copied files pendrive computer getting speed 36mb per secondits amazingly fast isnt itsoguys want tell u looking pendrive might itmy recommendation thisthanks reading review patiently
product costs 800 mrp discounts costs 839 whats happening amazon think legally void may go court file complaint
awesome got speed expected got writing speed 7080 mbps reading speed 90100 mbps sometimes got reading speed 300 mbps dont know trust got speed see proofs attached screenshots
ordered drives 24092018 stopped working minutes use sandisk drives prone going write protected mode longer add remove files words becomes read youre stuck whats tried several methods removing write protection drive listed sandisks site theres way remove reformat drive according sandisk customer support write protection errors occur flash drive detects potential fault within drive go writeprotected mode prevent data loss method fix update 290918 returned bad one got replacement amazon trying send file supriseonce write protected mode last taking refund amazon
charging mrp written 1490 charged 1665
absolutely right purchased recovery purposes means time isnt writing done reads whenever copy files 45 gb copying speed goes 10mbs even 67mbs worst tried kinds allignment tried sorts sizes data 1015 seconds speed even worst usb 20 drive transcend 20 always maintain speed 1520mbs pc tech decade anyone reading please dont buy drive go transcend even hp tried available drives available market experiment eventually fail expectation ive done maybe amazon kind extra sandisk seagatefor hdd transcend hp sony thumbdrives always satisfaction hddssd wd samsung still best drives available hope helps always last sandisk thumdrive ever used like transcend replaced several sandisk microsd cards failed without reasons still remember frustration loosing valuable data time mobile phones needed micro sd cards sandisk started good products think really sandisk failure
received product mrp mentioned rs800 however amazon charged rs847 also found scratch use promo code mentioned win 504gb expired 31st january 2017 sandisk ultra cz48 32gb usb 30 pen drive black
write protected got online procedure could help sandisk technical assistance gave possible solution either returnreplace amazon visit customer service centre return say potential fault cant recovered replacedreturned surely amazon returns far better option
dont think got 30 speed slow never expected amazoni think amazon concentrating quality coz earned alot
using times format give friend formatting disk space shrunk mere 2 gb got terrified couldnt believe seeing sandisk memory card business still reliable company comes money attaching screen shot pendrive properties hope make decision worth review save money
excellent performance claimed course one always remember clause claimed mbs advertised speak truth device actually exceeds claimed speed limit beginning readwrite process though transiently data transfer rate quickly drops 45 55 mbs usb 30 port pc intel core i7 6700k asus maximus viii formula motherboard ripjaws 16 gb 3000 mhz ddr4 ram obviously data transfer rate may suffer pc used substantially less powerful overall good product sandisk usual thanks amazon
didnt expect looking original product end high copy duplicate one dont reduce quality product frequent buyer previous sandisk ultra cz48 32gb usb 30 pen drive black working perfectly fine order one previous one working fine problem previous one working blue colour led light one replaced problem replacement one also wont working blue led light 760rs big amount least provide quality product give last time maintained standard dont drop price cannot maintained amendment product please specify dont try smart giving highest copy productsandisk ultra cz48 32gb usb 30 pen drive black
already bought lost somewhere bought know pendrive like one best pen drive price range also give 30 usb port also boost read write speed pendrive well gladly suggest guys go one looking 32gb pendrive ratings average pendrive pc speed 100 mbps 1010 30 usb pc pendrive speed 50 mbps 610 30 usb design 910 price 1010 u buy amazon
installed windows 7 pendrive getting issues like slow speed im getting 42 mbps write speed usb 30 port got pen drive 459 rs little bit heating issue transferring much data otherwise best pen drive price range
capacity 115 gb low overall rating 4 5 specially like file locking system way locks files nice feature nice
talking 100 mbps gives good speed first 10 second decrease 1012 mbps
please format pendrive ntfs file system otherwise u cant send file 4 gb pdrve reading writting speed awesome usb 30 speed generally depends nature file u sending
speed low 43 mbsec ordered website mentioned 180mbsec speed clearly cheating clients giving wrong information suggest go
lecturer bought item needs teach lessons av tools received new one returning faulty item thankful amazon working well things 286 gb 32 gb ad shows
overheating new 32gb usb drive runs hot plugged even use eject plug pen drive realize metal usb ports hot 16gb one heat crazily like wheres disk activity led new 32gb pen drive led indicator compare 16gb drive model disk activity orange led
export speed reaches maximum 40 mbps speed ordinary pendrive 2425 mbps boat speed recharge maximum 10 mbps ordinary pendrive 23 mbps although speed reach 100mbps reality shown product description great deal price especially amazon providing huge discount liked product much high speed stylish look within budget go without doubt thank amazon find review helpful please give us helpful vote really motivates us provide great reviews
writeprotected cant copy data usb cant format cant remove write protection complete mess design good protrudes sides back much still looks good quality make good
lookwise pendrive good pros aur cons pros 1 attractive design 2 read speed good 3 free 1 year subscription rescuepro deluxe recovery software 4 sandisk lock software free inside pendrive note formatting pendrive save sandisk lock software file hdd otherwise software deleted 5 usb 20 speed good around 9 mb copy pendrive hdd speed also good around 27 mb cons 1 usb 30 speed good around 12 mb copy pendrive hdd speed good around 65 mb 2 blue light indicate onoff continously unless remove pendrive usb port 3 pendrive gets little bit hot transfer big files
max copying speed noticed formating pendrive ntfs iss 95mbs happy quality sandisk 1st time useful bt one thing seems sad provide 28gb ina 32gb pendrive bt company provide minimum 30gb would suggest buy
got deal basically market price offline price wasnt issue testing speeds since needed store movies sandisk usb 3 assume wont much issue wanted 128 gb available model went options didnt work due reasons like price reliability since wouldve direct imports job serves purpose 64gb
product delivered time faster delivery product value money actual usage reaches speed 20 30 mbps usb 20 slot 70 80 mbps usb 30 slot data transfer speeds different depends pc configuration opinion blindly go
used userbenchmark test drive results pretty good usb 20 drive reads around 110 mbs whereas writes around 10 mbs usb 30 title misleading usb 30 design backwards compatible need advertise usb 30 ready cons usb port retractable would sometimes close inserting secureaccess software problems autoupdating otg apart overall price pretty decent performer
getting poor read write speed something wrong laptop sony vaio e series copy 159 gb folder copies max mb per sec takes 8 minutes copy speed doesnt go beyond 4mb sometimes falling 1mb 556kb per sec happening laptop windows 7 ultimate 32bit installed win8 laptop copied folder time speed goes 8mb per second speed keep changing 560kb sec 4 mb 78 mb per second dont know read somewhere enable usb legcy mode bios sony laptop bios doesnt show full options advanced tab cant enable usb legacy option think reason low speed desktop computers running windows 8 pro usb 2 port speed good cant remember exact speed copies 159 gb folder less minute getting poor readwrite speed dont immediately blame pen drive try computers

like thinking pendrive provide masaive speed compared usb 20 disappointed yeah pendrive faster usb 20 fast said company never able see write speed 100mbs sone strange thing regarding pendrive transferring huge file around 10gb notice initially speed around 20 mbs pendrive becomes hot 2 3 mins speed decreased around 68 mbs
purchased usb drive small size usb really tiny feels fragile delicate small size good carrying portable easy loose outer body transparent making difficult locate loose however good storage space 32gb small package observed copying large amount data 10gb large get 10 10 mbsecond transfer rate file size 100 mb 700 mb achieve transfer rate 36 mbsecond achieved transfer rate higher 40 mbsecond transfer rate drive computer also low packaging says transfer rate 150mbsec highly doubtful drive easily detected smartphones also observed drive becomes hot writing reading data observation recorded buyers also usb drive good people need large storage space wiling sacrifice transfer speed people wants transfer files mobile devices computers would find useful

writing review almost 2 months purchase usage covering important points 1 size perfect go tranferring inbuilt micro usb makes life easier 2 transfer speed really depends transferred case transferring 900 hd quality photos took around 7 mins 3 holding pendrive feels like break really minimal pressure surprising really sturdy 4 understanding concept opening closing pendrive took time undersand needs swift movements definately lacks 5 heats quite quickly 6out 36 gb storage 286 gb actually available storage rest 74 gb used storing rest inbuilt applications pendrive would given pendrive 5 stars feel 4 stats enough assessing pros cons
product compact looks fragile types bad ergonomics poor handling poor ease use 285gb 32 gb free use dont really understand whymy pen drives hardly show unaccounted data space occupancy amazon good prompt delivery
gold color selected kiya payment bhi gold ka adhik pay kiya parsal se black color ka pic mila wrong send product
seem trouble flash drives dont seem last slow year still working fine comes handy move files phone computer wise always searching adapter speed wise fast usb3 drives definitely much faster usb2 devices weary storing anything drives since develop problems stop working together
transferring larger files heats pendrive transfer files small proportion cut paste large many files time pen drive heats mobile transfer gets hanged
works well smartphones pc really amazing product superb looks great readwrite speed need otg cable connect smartphones
trust guys good speed easy use looking awesome heating issue doesnt matter dont need worry amazon service awesome fast
drive obviously looks good especially gold tint whole body theres also usual sandisk branding necessary emblem metal parts packaging also assuring thing keeps nagging cant find particular color sandisk site anyone finds official site would pleasure reading speed drive awesome around 130140 mbps terribly fat believe ssd destination advantages thing provide brilliant read speeds writing hand awful maximum speed getting around 1820 mbps thats usb 30 dont know whats wrong maybe model isnt designed writing speeds
san disk ultra 64 gb pendrive small sleek slightly bulkybut thats issue memory 586 gb usable memory readwrite speeds fast price point average 40 mbps obtained time go otg connectivity phones also fast use san disk memory zone appapk file comes pendrive purchase deleted looks love gold touch white colour apparently shimmers slightlyin bright sunlight package finally box comes sorry box slight packet like coverage holds pendrive firmly warranty card simply sayin budget friendly pendrive
though ads amazon show 64gb product actuality capacity per drive shown 572 gb dont know happens like buy regular shops never shows grave variance difference almost 7gb customers like upset astonished realise huge difference product capacity terms advertised part actual specifications sort breach terms
pros 32 gb storage connect directly micro usb charging pin mobiles also regular usb pen drive easy open close nice look color 30 gives higher speed data transfer rate transfer data lightening fast speed cons heat generating connecting devices perceive heat 20 models sometimes try insert micro usb mobile pin pen drive pin going frame annoying thing heating

buy anything sandisk written 30 actually 20 saying 20 speed data transfer 30useless product
whole purpose buying product defeated wanted save large pst files pen drive unfortunately cant store file least pst 5gb
first see item photo even hold packed piece looks good feels rich qualitywise open 2 drawbacks 1 hybrid usb pen drive pushed directions depending upon need usb micro usb however push side say usb 30 insert pc usb slot stopper hold position usb pushed usb port pushed backwards hold sides ie holding outer leads expect scandisk 2 outer protective stylish cover golden case show protect pen drive outer border sides cover top bottom side exposing pen drive hold pen drive grip top bottom feels uncomfortable far quality concerned scandisk trusted brand would expect good quality robust easy use design good quality drive get pen drive buy higher capacity premium product scandisk need improve designing part seriously consider ease use designing products
product wasting moneyit looks good productive stops working suddenlyi purchase amazone ago andafter using six months soit suddenly stopped workingits getting attached phoneneither getting readable laptopi bought rs 899 complete data gone itand also doesnt give claimed speedit give u 800 kbps 1314 mbps top speedwhich absolutely garbage flashdrive 30 though tge speed aspect never botherd muchbut sudden malfunction irked lot instead u go sony price range
slow pendrive ever used never seems like 30 advantage connect phone otherwise useless realized phone supports fat file system even allow copy large files pendrive connected pc lapop hand format ntfs file system pc copy large files recognised phone shows corrupted pd conclusion way much useful time pc mobile slow pd poor design value money

works fine heats bit works box android phones usb 3 usb 2 speed good lot better purchasing cheap usb otg adapter plugging normal pen drives also good otg adapter arsenal since might need connect normal pen drive day problem small heats pretty soon
old otg pendrive broken purchased one feel made plastic covering hold broken sandisk pendrive would look one bought right one fall ground pendrive covering boom

never liked messy otg cables phone pendrives perfect p ive using since month working quite smoothly readwrite speed around 5060 mbps pretty good design okay small easy carry improved takes little practice smoothly switch two connectors considering price offers considered value money could better cap protect connector oxidation dirt
ultra fast tiny dual usb pendrive best model sandisk memory zone android app best easy document movie song photos videos data backup software please note pen drive hard drive safely remove plug run process usb drive benifit dont currupt data life long usb drive
bought 16gb version pendrive made malaysia cost rs 499 see two ports one computerlaptop another mobiletablet etc works nicely devices usb 30 laptops port usb 20 got upto 10 mbps copying file laptop disappionted fact upto 2030 mbps however pendrive useful use pc mobile phone per cost satisfactory

vfm short pros cons see pics get idea product biggest condisadvantage tiny size delicate build copying speeds slow writing speeds otg mobile drive around 1 mbs tested low end redmi device durable metal body hence suggested various reviews might break open likely survive fall doubt bear day day usage storage get around 57 gb storage space box manuals pdf apk file occupying 5060 mb space looks cute sleek tiny ergonomics isnt ergonomic find difficult hold hand coz small size need get hanger thread sort thing hook make sure doesnt fall small size means difficult carry places also poor build quality slider mechanism would lot better honestly hard times pop otg usb sticks together poor delicate build quality seems would break next moment buy depends budget otg adapters market way slower want otg usb 30 comes best option unfortunately issues gets heated quickly
speed connectivity really good overall worst product design difficult even use pen drive preferred older version better speed much issue go older version black one
product totally wested purchase aug 17 memory reducing upto 585 mb way tray corrected
bought otg pendrive wanted transfer media directly phone instantly need storage space need use photos took impressed well designed altering usb micro usb ports quite sturdy durable would recommend everyone
got pendrive perfect excellent writing review bit late since useless write review soon u get product product would work excellent initially 6 months guess since purchasethe usb still working like champ thank amazon wonderful product perfect price suggest u get product amazon deliver timely affordable prices
ive using month see writing files drive goes high speed 20mbs limited time comes back 5mbs get usb 20 final size less 286 gb sandisk must improve area saw hp pen drive space sandisk 32 gb speed issues must verified
pendrive really good one let tell best 30 otg pendrive available market price range pendrive tiny shape makes premium due design vulnerable misplace pen drive flashing led amber light anyways need overall write speed read speed good enough disappointing liked unique design though pendrive problem handling ie u try switch either otg usb 30 bit stiff switch easily thats rest mark
far loving pros really fast read write speed usb 31 gen1 read 160mbps write 1619mbps good build quality micro usb opposite side sure 31g1 20 compact worth money tag hole present used key chain lols cons still micro yeah typec since cover ports dust collect inside
space available user least 119 gb 128 gb pendrive advertised 128 gb comes 128000000000 bytes revers conversion 128000000000102410241024 gb 119 gb actual space available 5gb less ie 114 gb please dont go alternative
drive started great gave good speeds used moving files laptop phone went downhill months use speed turned quite slow even copying image file size 3mb4mb takes 30 minutes something wrong piece got believe
product marketed write speed less 10mbs always
must travel lot easily connect pc mobile seamlessly also eases memory card space save things rarely use access needed con install app phone reads songs drive apps like vlc google music etc doesnt read itll hard got accustomed music playing apps
got amazon price rs 499 prime day sales 30 usb speed great moreover provides functionality connect smartphones well built otg 30 connectivity provision comes handy go dual microusb usb 30 connectors highspeed usb 30 superfast file transfers 150 mbs sandisk memory zone app easy file management compatible otgenabled android devices free memory smartphone tablet 5 years limited warranty
worst design could possibly come two sided pen drive even locking mechanism lock one end youre putting pendrive pc usb end slides back inside horrible design wasted money think next time
sandisk says guarantee read speed write speed im getting okay read speed say writing speed way less even usb 20 usb 20 pendrive gives 10mbps write speed usb 30 pendrive gives 5 times less transfer rate im getting 23mbps write speed buy product really want usb 30 preferences worth price
makes transfer files smartphone computer easy using pen drive one month face problem recommend everyone buy worth money awesome product conshave put extra efforts inserting port keeps closing otherwise awesome product dont face problem
amazon delivery service superb ordered item late night received free prime delivery door step 1130am next morning product meets features advertised website first impression tiny piece may even work properly may heat however moment works fine hdd ubuntu os much heating issues using os drive data readwrites normal formatted rewritten often rather using data transfer medium could also connect mobile devices supporting micro usb type connectors exceeding regard purpose purchased higher data transfer rates offered usb 30 max average transfer rate could observe tests 12mbsec however surely shows improvement 20 usb drive using previously
pendrive good shape covered neatly looks really good problem big one person like use otg connection extended period time tendsto get ejected sometimes gets currupted dont know problem product would recommend anyone
build quality really really terrible lightweight bad way much larger youd expect picture unless actually need dual usb drive stay far away one get robust usbatypeonly drive instead couple months mild use drive decided stop working apparent reason despite taking great care expose heavy mechanical stress
doubt product good writing review 5 months usage using laptop mobile transferring file sightly shakes pendrive gets ejected press pendrive restart transfer hindi agar mein se computer dalta hoon aur agni thoda se bhi hil jata hai yeah aur computer mein show nahi karta phir se dobara sahi se dabaane par wapas chalta hai mobile
nice build quality otg added advantage read speed super nice like getting around 200 mbs read speed say 1 gb copies 1015 seconds write speed always varies depends upon file size port use far got max 1920 mbs remove top plastic make compact using ps4 watching movies also tried secondary storage works fine lag
would recommend usb drive anyone looking carry files moght face need access android otg phones proven quite helpful whats good product convenient fast helpful need access data stored ur phone andor want transfer data computer phone whats good product little small might get lost easily make sure tie something onto easily find
speed shown descriptionit hardly touch 20mbps next heats like hell one facing problem connecting mobilethen first formate fat32only show mobile rest working good satisfied amazon service product
seeing great item ive bought two wife son best feature versatility theres need otg cable anything else plug pc smartphone directly first make sure smartphone otg compatible great item like edc item hang keychain greatness rubbing items keychain car key 12gb storage capacity bike key 8gb think growing usb mini usb connection pins cant wait see great work ill update review performance ever need buy another pendrive ill get doubt
dont worry pendrve ship flimsy looking feeling plastic speeds actually pretty good 1000 buck flash drive 22mbs write maxs 89 mbs write lows pretty clear cost savings done manufacturing process body like something person feel touching product hands pics make look sturdy somehow still said earlier 1000 buck drive okay ships wds trust tech
product good prise range plastic quality poor
speed nice heatsup quickly plastic quality good looks premium problemafter using long time small notch platicthis locks u shift otg usbthis notch gets disappeared finally shows trouble handling go solid build pendrive otg usb opposite ends like strontium pendrive awsome used due cost reason choosed one
product fast terms data transferyou easily connect pc mobile seamlessly also eases memory card space save things rarely use access needed
dual connection mode otg go pen drive really adds excellent convenience data transfer storage mobile devices usb portthe pen drive compact storage space 32gb sandisk brand ofcourse dependable small storage plastic box would better safe storage protection carrying pocket without scope damage good useful buy people keeping lots photo video audio files cost vs storage space gradually come
ran crystaldiskmark 6 drive completion got locked readonly mode first thought might software issue could resolved tried every recovery method found internet drive beyond repair amazon promptly replaced drive new one thinking first one might faulty decided test second drive test surprise second drive also died way please note already tested sandisks drives software still working fine opinion issue specific model ive also seen comments reporting issue thanks amazon got refund ill suggestion buy sandisks ultra 30 cz48 model otg adapter
attention user please informed usb 128gb bought actual size internal storage 114 gb straightaway 14 gb less company committingdeclaring way similar comment posted another customer 128gb checked planning go drive please make sure check low ratings comments well know exact loopholes product strictly dont reccommend product
shipping packing etc fine pendrive seemed work fine got benchmarked used software usbflashspeedcom surprised find usb 30 speed 20 32mbps read speed 18mbps write asked replacement came pretty fast benchmark gave around 140mbps read speed usb 30 however practically copying movie game speed unstable never crossed 60mbps doesnt feel like real usb30 still im pretty satisfied overall got 32gb offer 590rs
purchasing product gone reviews one thing clear writing speed great pendrive hopeful reading speed reading reviews observation number files copied morelike 100 reading speed drops drastically low 100kbps also cant avoided trying copy multiple attempts eg copying 10 files time destination folder pendrive reaches threshold speed gets reduced option return product replaced since design defect product bug issue cannot fixed
tiny size tiny price feature packed usb 30 transfer speed fast otg convenient esp people store files phone keep hooked keychain always handy secure tiny size one disadvantageits easy lose build metal slider plastic cant reckless sturdy enough withstand drops even minor wear tear
really hybrid easily copy mobile phone pendrive order copy things mobile theres software provided pendrive required install easy installation first plastic material used outer case good quality copy process speed also good mobile phone drive thing observed heat factor connecting mobile phone pendrive easily getting heated suspecting continuous usage might impact memorypendrive
recently boughtit getting heated using mobile otg also getting attached mobile easily using pen drive brand working fine made buy good pen drive hope company get updated make user friendly
using many days didnt got problem suitable types devices dslr tv car specially mobile enjoyed alote using sandisk back app surprised important deleted files get easily awesome tech guys recommended everyone note format continuesly stay away liquids pendrive aashish wadekar
never got offer bought mistake speed slows transfers mobiles heats used big screen seems problems keeping hurry exception converted type c shows difference worked like angel working shifts phone well pendrive
good product sandisk actual write speed 30mbps read speed 1015mbps company mentioned speed upto 150mbps false advertising pendrive used otg supports types smartphones equipped otg feature built quality bit poor seems product covered cheap plastic still pendrive job perfectly last would say good product low cost value money item
didnt realise till held hands type pendrive comfortable use frequently try use port takes type technique make sure outer cover slip nicely designed locking mechanism cover needs improved good part size small also getting heated much faster pendrives
ordered san disk ultra dual 32gb usb 30 otg pen drive store photos songs checked product tracking status showed delivered manish also singed manish product delivered per edd estimate shipping date delivered late contacted amazon customer service raised complaint 34 days finally got delivered understand amazon huge online shopping platform might may occur kind scenarios anyways amazon understands customer service thus assisthelped lot good job amazon great work done amazon seller
careful buying pendrive much heating minutes usage also starts heating performance becomes poor case minutes heating data transfer stopped automatically strongly recommend cut paste always use copy paste pendrive chances data loss careful
sandisk dual drive lives upto brand name considering transfer speeds usage thing irritating design plastic push unit encompassing dual plugs doesnt look durable hard handle locking mechanism makes difficult plug hard reach usb sockets like ones behind wall mounted led tvs
device similar old ultra dual usb pendrive 30 used come black modelrigid body bodys build quality isnt durable handle care design may appealing doesnt work well hold tightly onto uninserting part usb slider read write speed similar packaging good thank amazon
3 stars lacks important aspect using either ends lock doesnt one u want plug usb port happen push end makes difficult use really work fingers way one end stays intact pushed
think product good disappointed realized month later purchase given 32 gb instead 64 gb disappointed end actually printed 64 gb actual storage capacity 32 gb cant return cause return window closed feel ripped guess thats fault paying attention details
life saver lot time check pdf phone lets face everywhere get hold wifi printer go cyber cafe printing handing phone really scary buy file manager would work used file manager android automatically detected usb drive
hi copied 20 gb file took 30 min using teracopy fine able delete format disk operations used easus tool pny usb tool regedit hacks many others use use one file copied cannot anything
nowadays need carry usb drives connect laptops well smartphone otg pendrive handy useful works perfectly fine mobile speed also ok however get hot connect mobile dont know previous never problem
slider lock mechanism hold shell push inside slot goes shell cant use wall mount tv sliding problem earthing problem home try use holding metal part definitely give mild shock surprisingly previous gen pen drive sandisk slider lock
like product trust sandisk fast also durable material dont break nothing ever goes wrong functionality products supports devices well also gives really good speed data transfer thats like youre thinking purchase 16gb dont would suggest go 32gb better option gives double storage
hats multipurpose design moreover fast see data transfer speed almost equivalent ssd sleek lightweight good looking concern heating lot may ultra fast performance worried longevity
completely open becomes really hot copying filesso someone could get hurtproduct really amazing waiting price come 549 earlier purchased older version one completely closed topso mich better thisperformance wisethere problem allit delivers really great speed 30 port also 20 portbuy get 549 thats lowest price tracking price long time finally got
perfect moving data mobile phone pc car usb needed phone music car port wav format needed space got job done started move 23gb music data mobile pen drive wore shoes got elevator got 10 floors got car see transfer data already complete thats breeze right
bad im unhappy buying please dont buy heated connect phone within 1 min temp approx 100 f connect android phone
bill actual price rs 43983 gst rs 7917 price 18 tax price buy online got pen drive rs 519 product useful delivered original form storage 2863 gb available issue design pen drive covered side careful handling usage one drop liquid may stop product functioning
otg cum pen drive amazingly compact hesitant buy convenience give use helpful comes software install ur phone n transfering data cool secure sometimes risk data corrupted normal easy use durable pin gets frame approx 29 gb u get 32 gb model
doesnt completable pc formet usb detected add 2movies connected lenovo mi oppo motorola phones doesnt support phones try connect led result dont support ledso waste money please dont buy iti totally dissatisfied product amazon time ur product waste money
cost 100 bucks less hp counterpart heating however hp model later metal body due conduction heat felt severe durability moderate compared hp full metal bodied counterpart sliding design bit headache continuous use slider goes either ways ease make difficult plug device without sliding back plugging bucks saved bucks saved cheerio
everything goodbut heats lot

bit pricey
although product capable easy file transfer different platforms windows linux mac ios android thanks file format exfat would recommend use file format drive lose multi platform capability terms speed product meet claimed speed retailer ie 150 mbs stays around 5 20 mbs speed ordered even though 30 port also 30 still getting desired speed screenshot attached terms build average compact easy play around plastic slider shell gives protection ordered backup drive 53 gb important files taking eternity happy

good flash drive san disk king flash drives cant go wrong works well lot data storesbut butplease carefuldont fiddle product muchits flimsy break handle incorrectly
fast read write speeds 2 cons iof device two ports either side slide one hold tightly slide whose laptop charger socket near usb port may easy plug together
product good heating issues much reviewers pointed u read details products mention abt heat c prbly issues much heating little disappointed design pendrive wish caps close pendrive handling better
good product may heat little bit micro usb side using dual drive otg obvious performance excellent hanging issues excellent companion specially long tours internet connection available slow per technical point view pendrive 20 henceforth speed concern availability usb 30 pendrives market dual drives built special purposes including otg entertainments also therefore advisable use device pendrive built quality compatibility everything good im strongly recomend device

expect much reasonable theres plastic slider move usb microusb need careful keep mind fact functions perfectly otherwise reviewing item
product shown picture instead sending sliding pendrive 30 32gb seller sent fixed pendrive 20 otg 30 sliding feature
one newest designs sandisk otg function helps managing mobile storage space especially phone limited storage capacity either due low capacity memory card memory card overall good looks easy operation works fine deal miss opinion
compatibility issues good job thank checked speeds everything fine except data transfer pc pen drive 20 mbs pen drive pc 150 mbs specified product description
write drive transfer speed great usb 30 heats lot build cheap plastic body break falls thrice rest good two slots compatibility value money budget device

writing review years usage pros simplistic design descent available storage space faster data transfer mobileotgpendrivelaptops approx claimed easy use cons heating easily even short time usage length product much suitable comfortable use micro usb around year otgs microusb part connecting properly sometimes disconnects often overall good product go
good transferring speeds serve handy n unlike sandisks dont heat glitch durable much scratch prone steel exteriors keep wraps time also provided plastic cap mobile terminal end functionally good
writing review month usage definitely dont recommend buying since bunch issue especially build quality copying speed good body seems made thick silver really weak felt even plastic also better regards cap otg plastic using bunch times become unfit cap otg regards speed device copying 1gb data 57minsit took time per usage surely never suggest long time usage
one fastest drives get reasonable price impressive write read speeds physical construction confidenceinspiring also attractive look hold though also larger size pen drives doesnt activity led alhamdulillah
